This repo includes a set of tests that can be used to assess the skills of
a candidate for a JavaScript position

## I want to work on the tests; what do I do?
To use the tests, you will need to install Node -- you can do this via the
[download page](http://nodejs.org/#download) or using
[Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) if you are on a Mac.

Note that on Windows, there are some reports that you will need to restart
after installing Node - see #12.

You can clone or download this repo. Once you have done so, from the root
directory of the repo, run:

    npm install
    node bin/serve

You can then view the tests in your browser at
[http://localhost:4444](http://localhost:4444).

When you visit that page, all of the tests should be failing; your job is to
get the tests to pass. To do this, you'll need to refer to the tests in the
files in the `tests/app` directory, and edit the files in the `app/` directory.
Once you update a test, you can reload the test page in the browser to see
whether it worked.

You can also run (most of) the tests on the command line:

    npm test

The command line runner is a work in progress; contributions welcome :)


The repo includes jQuery, Backbone, Underscore, and RequireJS. If there's other
stuff you'd find useful, you can put it in the `lib` directory.
